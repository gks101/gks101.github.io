[![Deploy static content to Pages](https://github.com/gks101/gks101.github.io/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gks101/gks101.github.io/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This Single Page Application has all the important Projects, Docs, Books and Blogs etc. that I have developed or created for clients for my own learning purposes.

The aim of this portfolio is to showcase my Development and Problem-Solving skills & experiences as well as make others learn from then, take inspiration.

I also list all my open source projects where you can contribute or use the codebase to learn and make your own application.
